# Sales-Report-PT-Kimia-Farma-TBK

Project-Based Virtual Internship is an internship program that is held by Rakamin Academy. I joined a virtual internship as a Big Data Analyst at PT Kimia Farma Tbk. During the program, interns were assigned to learn about data analytics by reading articles and watching videos. Moreover, in the final program, the interns were assigned to make a data mart (base table and aggregate table) and a data visualization/dashboard.

On this occasion, I want to share a little about my process for creating a base table and aggregate table using MySQL and a dashboard using Google Data Studio.
